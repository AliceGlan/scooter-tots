# Scooter Tots

Scooter Tots website is an advertisement for an event/club for mums, dads and other caregivers to take their preschool-aged children too. This website is for tired mums and dads with children with lots of energy and an interest in scooters, bikes and other wheelbase riding toys. It gives mums and dads an opportunity to get out of the house and socialise with other people and children an opportunity to play with friends with a similar interest. Parenting can be an isolating time, this club gives socialisation opportunities to both parent and child. This site communicates what the club is, the benefits of joining a group, where and when they plan to meet, and an opportunity to submit a form with some questions or sign up to a mailing list.

Scooter Tots website is designed to be responsive, knowing that users may access and use this website on a range of different devices.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Scooter Tots website colour pallet] (documentation/ST-colour-scheme.png)

The website uses bright colours that are playful. I alo chose colours that reflec a park or outside expereince of a sunny day, with the blue sky, yellow sun and green grass. he colour pallette was created using [coolors] (https:/coolors.co/). 

### Typography

Google Fonts was used for all the fonts on the site. I chose the logo font 
as a curved playful font and for the main section I chose an easy to read font. 
- Fira Sans is use
 for the main content
- B used for the heading logo and welcome tag line. 

### Imagery 
Images were sourced from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/search/child%20scooter/). I have chosen images that show children having fun in a range of possible similar settings that the groups might be held. I have also chosen images that reflects the use of other wheeled toys and is not specific to scooters.
